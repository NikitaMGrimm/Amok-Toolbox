# Amok-Toolbox
Amok Runner FOEN Puzzle practice for speedrunning 

Simple program that simulates the 4-number lock in Amok Runner. 
The player can use the 'a' and 'd' keys to move the cursor left and right, respectively, 
and the 'w' and 's' keys to increment or decrement the digit at the current cursor position.

Attempts are timed. The game will reset with a new lock code after each reset. 

Controls shown in the top left.

This is a javascript/html/css version of https://github.com/NikitaMGrimm/amok-runner-foen-lock which was made in python with pygame.
(Angyeoung translated my pygame program to this)
